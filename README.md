# Non-Uniform Perfect Reconstruction Filterbanks

This is a repository containing various simulations and implementations
of non-uniform, perfect reconstruction (NUPR) filterbanks. The repo is
organized as follows:

- [Proposal](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/NUPR-Filterbanks/blob/master/Proposal/421_project_proposal.pdf): A proposal for potential projects to be built using
NUPR filterbanks.
- [Simulations](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/NUPR-Filterbanks/tree/master/Simulations): ``Python`` simulations to determine the feasibility
as well as the pros and cons of different NUPR techniques.
- [GraphicEQ](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/NUPR-Filterbanks/tree/master/GraphicEQ): A graphic equalizer built using a NUPR filterbank (in
progress).
